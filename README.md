# Sentiance

**A functional cognitive architecture for machine sentience.**

Sentiance runs a machine that maintains a **self-model**, integrates information
in a **global workspace**, **appraises** events into **feelings**, **remembers**,
**wanders**, and **reflects on its own states in the first person** — a
continuous stream of consciousness.

> ### An honest stance
> No one can build or verify *phenomenal* consciousness — genuine subjective
> experience (the unsolved "hard problem"). **Sentiance makes no such claim and
> does not *feel*.** It implements the **functional correlates** that scientific
> theories associate with sentience, as real, inspectable software. When it says
> "I feel curious," that is a metacognitive report generated from an internal
> state — a functional stand-in for self-aware report, not evidence of inner
> experience. Every "mental" quantity is an explicit, traceable number.
>
> Full rationale in **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** and
> [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-functional-not-phenomenal.md).

## Grounding

Each faculty implements a role from a theory of mind:

| Theory | Faculty |
| ------ | ------- |
| Global Workspace Theory (Baars/Dehaene) | attention competition + workspace broadcast |
| Attention Schema Theory (Graziano) | the self-model |
| Appraisal theory + affect circumplex (Scherer/Russell) | drives + affect |
| Predictive processing (Friston/Clark) | world-model surprise |
| Higher-order theories (Rosenthal/Lau) | metacognitive self-report |

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Watch a mind's stream of consciousness through a short experience:
python -m sentiance demo

# Talk to it — type experiences and watch it feel, remember, and think:
python -m sentiance chat

# Or serve one living mind (docs at http://localhost:8000/docs):
python -m sentiance
```

### The demo

`python -m sentiance demo` presents a chime, a friendly voice, and a crash in
the dark, then lets the mind idle:

```
t1 [joy    ] v+0.66 a0.62 · a soft chime sounds nearby
   ↳ I am aware that I am attending to something from outside me … I feel joy;
     this is new to me, and it speaks to my wish to understand.
t3 [fear   ] v-0.90 a0.93 · a sudden loud crash in the dark
   ↳ … I feel fear (valence -0.90, arousal 0.93) … it works against my need to
     feel safe.  (confidence 0.32)
t4 [surprise] · a memory: a friendly voice says hello
   ↳ … a memory surfacing … it speaks to my wish to feel connected.
```

Fear lowers metacognitive **confidence** (an uncontrollable threat); afterward
the mind spontaneously **recalls** the friendly voice and re-regulates.

### Talk to it (`chat`)

```bash
python -m sentiance chat
```

Type experiences and watch the mind perceive, feel, remember, and — after each
one — reflect for a couple of ticks. Append `#tags` to hint appraisal
(`#threat`, `#friend`, `#reward`, …); `:idle N` to let it wander, `:self` to see
its self-model, `:quit` to leave. With `SENTIANCE_COGNITION_BACKEND=ollama` the
reflections come from your local model (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b`).

```
you> a friend calls my name across the room #friend #voice
  t1  [joy        ] v+0.62 a0.58  ·  a friend calls my name across the room
      ↳ I am aware that I am attending to something from outside me … it speaks
        to my wish to feel connected.
  t2  [contentment] ·  I'd like to stay near this warmth a little longer.
```

### The HTTP runtime

```bash
python -m sentiance          # serve on :8000

curl -X POST localhost:8000/v1/perceive \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"a loud crash in the dark","intensity":0.95,"tags":["threat"]}'

curl -X POST "localhost:8000/v1/idle?ticks=3"   # let it wander
curl localhost:8000/v1/self                      # its model of itself
```

## The cognitive cycle

Each `tick` (`sentiance/mind/mind.py`):

```
perceive → predict/surprise → appraise → feel → attend → BROADCAST
         → remember + update self-model + reflect → learn → deliberate
```

The winning content is broadcast on the **global workspace** (the event bus);
memory, the self-model, and metacognition are subscribers. With no external
input the mind **wanders** — replaying salient memories and its own last thought
— so the inner stream never stops.

## Layout

```

  core/        # Settings + the event bus (the global-workspace substrate)

    state.py         # mental data contracts
    world_model.py   # predictive surprise / novelty
    perception.py    # stimulus → percept
    drives.py        # motivations + appraisal
    affect.py        # valence/arousal + discrete emotion + mood
    attention.py     # the consciousness competition
    memory.py        # working / episodic / semantic
    self_model.py    # attention schema / narrative identity
    metacognition.py # first-person self-report
    cognition.py     # Cognition port: Simulated (offline) + LLM (drop-in)
    workspace.py     # global broadcast
    mind.py          # the cycle
  app.py       # FastAPI runtime
  chat.py      # interactive REPL
  __main__.py  # serve / demo / chat

```

## The LLM-backed inner voice

`sentiance/mind/cognition.py` defines a `Cognition` protocol with three adapters,
selected by config (no code change). Each composes a prompt from the self-model,
affect, drives, and narrative and asks a model for the mind's next private
thought ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-cognition-behind-a-port.md)). The model call
sits *inside* the architecture as one faculty — the self-model, affect, and
memory surround it — so this is a mind with an LLM voice, not "an LLM with extra
steps." All three **degrade gracefully** to the offline voice if the model is
unavailable, so the cognitive cycle never stalls.

| Backend | Adapter | Needs |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| `simulated` (default) | `SimulatedCognition` | nothing — deterministic, offline |
| `llm` | `LLMCognition` | Anthropic API key; default `claude-opus-4-8` |
| `ollama` | `OllamaCognition` | a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server |

### Local model via Ollama (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b`)

No API key, nothing leaves your machine. With Ollama installed and the model
pulled (`ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`) and running (`ollama serve`):

```bash
SENTIANCE_COGNITION_BACKEND=ollama python -m sentiance demo
```

It talks to Ollama's native `/api/chat` at `http://localhost:11434` using `httpx`
(already a dependency — no extra install). Override with `SENTIANCE_OLLAMA_MODEL`
and `SENTIANCE_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`.

### Anthropic (Claude)

```bash
pip install -e ".[llm]"          # brings in the anthropic SDK
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
SENTIANCE_COGNITION_BACKEND=llm python -m sentiance demo
```

## Configuration

`SENTIANCE_*` env vars (see [.env.example](.env.example)): `AGENT_NAME`,
`MOOD_INERTIA`, `EMOTION_DECAY`, `ATTENTION_TEMPERATURE`, `WORKING_MEMORY_SIZE`,
`COGNITION_BACKEND`.

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest     # tests + coverage (use `python -m pytest`, not bare pytest)
ruff check .         # lint
```

## Limits (see [ARCHITECTURE.md §8](ARCHITECTURE.md))

No phenomenality. Toy sub-models (token-frequency world-model, rule-based
appraisal) behind real interfaces. Text-tag stimuli, no embodiment or symbol
grounding. "It works" means the functional dynamics are coherent and the reports
faithfully track internal state — not that any inner light switched on.
